<p>
    Necrolab provides power rankings, leaderboard rankings, and daily rankings for the Crypt of the NecroDancer community. It also runs seasonal daily tournaments, where players can compete with each other of the course of a season by playing the daily that's available in-game.

<span class="menu_small">History</span>
<p>
    The very beginnings of this site started as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F_cTvQp8gehUnRpdZ2fKqHhE7Gobrcf2tXLPkvEpGyg/edit?pli=1#gid=391506336">Google Document</a> created by <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/wilarseny">Wilarseny</a> during the game's pre-release beta. Wilarseny would retrieve data from the leaderboards, scrub the data, and calculate power rankings for the top 100 players using a series of spreadsheet formulas as the algorithm. This was manually intensive task so he collaborated with <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/squega">Squega</a> to build a website to automate the calculation of these power rankings. 
</p>
<p>
    During this site's development the algorithm originally used in the spreadsheets, intended to calculate only the top 100 players, was changed by <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/jakkdl">Jakkdl</a> to apply to all players in the leaderboards. This algorithm was expanded to also apply to the daily leaderboards as well.
</p>
<p>
    The site launched shortly prior to the game's launch and has been collecting data since.
